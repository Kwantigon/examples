# Swagger-based R client

Whenever you change the API definition (and also before you run the example
for the first time) you need to run the following script:

```shell
./on-api-update.sh
```

## Running the example

Run R and inside the interpreter execute (note that the first
invocation will take some time as required dependencies will be
installed):

```r
source("dept-plot.r")
```
